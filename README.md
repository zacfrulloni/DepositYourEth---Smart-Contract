# DepositYourEth---Smart-Contract
DepositYourEth is a smart contract that can be used to transact ether between metamask accounts.
For this case I have used a landlord and tenants that can deposit ether. The ether can only be withdrawn from the landlord address
Steps to Reproduce:

- insert rinekby infura api + 12 word mnemonic;
- run: node compile and node deploy ;
- copy deployed address to deposits.js;
- to run on localhost: npm run dev;
